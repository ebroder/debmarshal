UML CBTB Tests
--------------
Prereqs:
- Debian/Ubuntu Machine
- ssh-key, if it requires a password make sure it is available in a ssh-agent
(to generate run ssh-keygen)
- Ability to sudo as root with the current user
- Reliable networking
- Willingness to debug issues
- A reliable Ubuntu mirror. Update /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/proxy with the
  url of your local and or reliable Ubuntu mirror. anl.gov is usually ok, but
  if you experience errors with debootstrap, try changing the mirror and give
  it another go.

Notes:
- As of this writing the test environment is now hardy, and we pull a tarball
  of useful debs from googlecode in case your mirror sucks.
- If a failure occurs early on, try again. Do not take this as a test failure,
  chances are you have a unreliable network connection, or someone changed
  permissions while we were working.
- If you wish to test using debian etch, pass DIST=etch
  LINUXDISTRIBUTION=debian to smoke-test as env variables

Running tests:
- `bash setup.sh` -- You probably want to do this once by hand
- `bash smoke-test.sh` -- This will run a single node and dual node test to
  give zumastor a good workout
- You may append --all to smoke-test.sh's command line if you wish to run all
  cbtb tests with UML.
