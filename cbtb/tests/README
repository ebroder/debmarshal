Writing test scripts:
   Test scripts are run as root on the first virtual instance created to run
the test.  The current zumastor packages are already installed and have had no
configuration done.  Additional packages may be installed using aptitude,
though their pre-existence should be checked before installing so non-Debian
images like PTXdist can also run the tests without failing.
   An LVM volume group sysvg with available space (16M on PTXdist, a few G
on dapper) is available to carve out necessary origin and snapshot stores. 
The test script should do this.
   If there are multiple instances required for the test, the script should
ssh to the other node in $IPADDR2, and set up /etc/hosts as necessary on
both machines.  2-node scripts should be in tests/2/, and single node
scripts in tests/1/.
   Scripts should return 0 on success, and any non-zero value on failure.
Tests should only take a few minutes to boot and run, and can expect to be
killed after 1 hour in any event.  All output is logged by the test harness. 
Typically, TAP messages (see man Test::Tutorial) are printed to let the
person reading the logs know what stage each test script got to.  These may
be processed by other tools to generate test summaries, but this is not
currently done.
