Host setup scripts.  You may wish to perform these actions by hand rather
than the script, so you know what they're doing to your host setup.
See ../host-scripts/README for typical runtime use.

dependencies.sh - install packages on the host required by the cbtb test
environment.

interfaces-bridge.sh - set up /etc/network/interfaces with the static
  private bridge required by the rest of the cbtb environment and tunbr.

proxy.sh - Configure Apache2 as a mod_proxy of the Ubuntu and Debian
  archives, rather than having to copy the entire archive to local disk or
  open a squid hole into the cbtb environment and suffer apt-get/squid
  protocol race conditions.

atftpd.sh - installs atftpd, downloads the netboot installers for
  Ubuntu/dapper, and unpacks the netboot installers in /tftpboot.  If run
  under sudo, also creates /tftpboot/$USER so the unprivileged user may
  provide their own netboot kernels and initrd.

dapper-i386.sh - run unprivileged under tunbr to create a dapper/i386
  template image.

etch-i386.sh - run unprivileged under tunbr to create an etch/i386 template
  image.

test-dapper-i386.sh - run under tunbr to test boot the dapper/i386 image,
  and optionally run any other script passwd as an argument in a snapshot,
  leaving the template unchanged.

test-etch-i386.sh - run under tunbr to test boot the dapper/i386 image,
  and optionally run any other script passwd as an argument in a snapshot,
  leaving the template unchanged.


Other scripts and files in this directory are used by those documented
above.  The scripts here need to run where their arguments and supporting
files are located, but not necessarily where the script itself is.
