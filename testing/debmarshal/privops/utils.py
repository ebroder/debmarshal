debmarshal utilities for privileged operations

This module contains the functions needed to support privileged
operations, by separating the act of gaining privilege from actually
using that privilege.

  privileges by using a small setuid wrapper binary.

  If a function wrapped with runWithPrivilege is called by a non-root
  user, execute the setuid wrapper with the arguments passed in.

  If a function is re-executed through the setuid wrapper, the
  function arguments and keyword arguments are passed in through the
  command line in YAML.

  For security reasons, all YAML dumps and loads occur using the
  "safe" parser, which will only (de-)serialize built-in types. This
  means that arguments to and return values from functions wrapped in
  runWithPrivilege must be limited to built-ins.

  The return value or raised exceptions of the function are also
  passed from the setuid subprocess back to the caller via standard
  out, so functions wrapped in runWithPrivilege shouldn't print
  anything.

  Args:
    subcommand: This is used as the first argument to the setuid
      binary. Since the setuid binary simply executes this module, the
      subcommand is also tracked internally for dispatching
