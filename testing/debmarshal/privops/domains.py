"""debmarshal privileged virtual domain operations.

  This function checks that the network name passed in is a network
  known to (i.e. created by) debmarshal. It also verifies that the
  network was created by the user calling the function.

  Args:
    net: The name of the debmarshal network.
    virt_con: A read-only libvirt.virConnect instance. We'll open one
      of our own if one isn't passed in. Since libvirt network
      information is shared across all hypervisors, virt_con can be a
      connection to any libvirt driver.

  Raises:
    debmarshal.errors.NetworkNotFound if the named network doesn't
      exist.
    debmarshal.errors.AccessDenied if the network isn't owned by the

  createDomain creates a domain for a virtual machine used as part of
  a debmarshal test and boots it up.

  We do no validation or accounting of memory allocations from the
  privileged side. Since debmarshal is intended to be run on
  single-user machines, the worst case scenario is a DoS of yourself.

  Args:
    memory: str containing the amount of memory to be allocated to the
      new domain. This should include a suffix such as 'G' or 'M' to
      indicate the units of the amount.
    disks: list of strs of paths to disk images, in the order that
      they should be attached to the guest. All disk images must be
      owned by the user calling createDomain.
    network: The name of the network to attach this VM to. The netwok
      must have been created using
      debmarshal.privops.networks.createNetwork by the user calling
      createDomain.
    mac: The MAC address of the new VM.
    hypervisor: What hypervisor to use to start this VM. While it's
      possible to mix hypervisors amongst the domains for a single
      test suite, it is the caller's responsibility to keep track of
      that when destroyDomain is called later. Currently only qemu is
      supported.
