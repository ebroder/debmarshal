  createNetwork creates an isolated virtual network within libvirt. It
  picks an IP address space that is as-yet unused (within debmarshal),
  and assigns that to the network. It then allocates IP addresses and
  MAC addresses for each of the hostnames listed in hosts.

  createNetwork tracks which users created which networks, and
  debmarshal will only allow the user that created a network to attach
  VMs to it or destroy it.

  Currently IP addresses are allocated in /24 blocks from
  10.100.0.0/16. 100 was chosen both because it is the ASCII code for
  "d" and to try and avoid people using the lower subnets in 10/8.

  This does mean that debmarshal currently has an effective limit of
  256 test suites running simultaneously. But that also means that
  you'd be running at least 256 VMs simultaneously, which would
  require some pretty impressive hardware.

  Args:
    hosts: A list of hostnames that will eventually be attached to
      this network
    dhcp: Whether to use DHCP or static IP addresses. If dhcp is True
      (the default), createNetwork also configures dnsmasq listening
      on the new network to assign IP addresses

  Returns:
    A 4-tuple containing:
      Network name: This is used to reference the newly created
        network in the future. It is unique across the local
        workstation
      Gateway: The network address. Also the DNS server, if that
        information isn't being grabbed over DHCP
