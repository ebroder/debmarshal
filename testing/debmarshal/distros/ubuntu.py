  If the preseed file has some number of blocks starting with "###

  part of the kernel command line.

  This function is not your mother; if your preseed file forgets the
  closing block, we won't tell you, and the behavior of the function
  is not well-defined.

  It's also your problem to be sure that none of the options to be
  passed in on the command line contain spaces, because the kernel
  isn't clever enough to deal with them.
