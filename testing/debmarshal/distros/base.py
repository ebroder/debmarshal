class Distribution(object):
  """Superclass representation of an abstract Linux distribution.

  Classes derived from Distribution represent Linux distributions and
  the mechanism by which one can be installed/imaged.

  The code and comments refer a lot to Linux distributions.  This
  class could potentially be used for any operating system for which
  an unattended install is possible, although whether it can be booted
  depends a lot on the specific virtualization technology being used.

  For a distribution install, there are two stages. The first stage
  installs a completely uncustomized base OS; the second customizes
  the base image for use with a particular test case.

  Both stages can have a set of configuration options, some of which
  can be set by users of the distribution class, some which can't be,
  and some which must be. Together, these options can be used to
  uniquely identify a given snapshot.

  Options with defaults can be overridden using an
  /etc/debmarshal/distros.conf configuration file.

  Attributes:
    base_defaults: A dict with the default configuration options for
      the base image.
    base_configurable: A set of option names that can be set by users
      of the distribution. Any elements which aren't also defined in
      base_defaults must be passed in by the user.
    custom_defaults: The default configuration options for the stage
      2 image.
    custom_configurable: The set of option names that can be set by
      users for stage 2. Any elements which aren't also defined in
      custom_defaults must be passed in by the user.
    _version: A version number for the distribution generator. This
      should be uniquely tracked by each Distribution subclass, and
      incremented whenever changes to the Distribution subclass would
      affect the generated images.
