  users, who might be seeing error messages that were otherwise
  handled.

  withoutLibvirtError will set a new error handler that ignores
  errors, allowing them to bubble up as exceptions instead. So that
  withoutLibvirtError can be used on functions that might call each
  other, and because it is never desirable for the default error
  handler to be used in debmarshal, withoutLibvirtError does not reset
  the error handler to its default.
