"""debmarshal setuid support module

This module provides the necessary input sanitation and command
wrappers to allow debmarshal test suites to be run by unprivileged
users.

The main privileged operations for VM-based test suites is the
networking configuration. Depending on the virtualization technology
being used, this may also include creating the guest domain, so we'll
cover that here as well.

Although debmarshal is currently using libvirt to reduce the amount of
code needed, we won't be accepting libvirt's XML config format for
these privileged operations. This both limits the range of inputs we
have to sanitize and makes it easier to switch away from libvirt in
the future.
