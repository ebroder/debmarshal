"""debmarshal setuid support module

This module provides the necessary input sanitation and command
wrappers to allow debmarshal test suites to be run by unprivileged
users.

The main privileged operations for VM-based test suites is the
networking configuration. Depending on the virtualization technology
being used, this may also include creating the guest domain, so we'll
cover that here as well.

Although debmarshal is currently using libvirt to reduce the amount of
code needed, we won't be accepting libvirt's XML config format for
these privileged operations. This both limits the range of inputs we
have to sanitize and makes it easier to switch away from libvirt in
the future.

  If a function wrapped with runWithPrivilege is called by a non-root
  user, execute the setuid wrapper with the arguments passed in.

  If a function is re-executed through the setuid wrapper, the
  function arguments and keyword arguments are passed in through the
  command line in YAML.

  For security reasons, all YAML dumps and loads occur using the
  "safe" parser, which will only (de-)serialize built-in types. This
  means that arguments to and return values from functions wrapped in
  runWithPrivilege must be limited to built-ins.

  The return value or raised exceptions of the function are also
  passed from the setuid subprocess back to the caller via standard
  out, so functions wrapped in runWithPrivilege shouldn't print
  anything.

    subcommand: This is used as the first argument to the setuid

  debmarshal will only allow the user that created a network to attach
  VMs to it or destroy it.

  Currently IP addresses are allocated in /24 blocks from
  10.100.0.0/16. 100 was chosen both because it is the ASCII code for
  "d" and to try and avoid people using the lower subnets in 10/8.
