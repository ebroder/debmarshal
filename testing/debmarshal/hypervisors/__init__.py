"""Hypervisor-specific configuration for debmarshal test domains.

The debmarshal.hypervisors package contains classes to help with any
specialized configuration required for the different virtualization
engines supported by debmarshal.

Note that because debmarshal.privops.domains uses
debmarshal.hypervisors to generate the libvirt XML for a domain,
debmarshal.hypervisors and all modules under it are trusted code.

In the root of the package, we load each submodule to make sure that
it's registered in debmarshal.hypervisors.base.hypervisors.
