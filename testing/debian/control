Description: Virtualized, isolated total-system testing
 The debmarshal testing framework is designed to simplify testing of
 total systems and multiple systems. To run a debmarshal test suite,
 the entire environment under test (including necessary dependencies)
 is created in a series of virtual machines, which can then be safely
 tested and abused.
